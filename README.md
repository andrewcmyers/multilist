# multilist
Multilist is a Java checklist/TODO application that runs using JavaFX
currently and is intended to run as an Android application. The goal
is also to use Fabric (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Fabric) as
the back end for persistent storage, so that checklists can be shared
securely among multiple users.
